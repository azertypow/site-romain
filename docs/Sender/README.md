# AM.01

A X-months live-generated sound stream composed from hopes, fears and dreams of contributors from the EPFL+ÉCAL Lab

When the physical experiential relationship to a work of art is disrupted in this suspended time , how to engage participating spectators in situ and extramuros ? AM.01 is asocial experience who question emotional daily feeling from a group of people who in the past were gathered together.

By adopting the sound aesthetics and the communication network architecture of late 70’s answering machine, this project expresses through a sound experience the discussion between sender and receiver. At the time these lines are written, and as long as social distance is imposed on us, AM.01 invites people from the EPFL+ECAL Lab to give their voice to what they expect, hope, or fear for the future, to question the landing after this suspended time.

And then what? This X-months interactive discussion this experience will then lead to sound time capsule which will offer us a glance, or rather a listening on the past, lived collectively and without physical distance.
